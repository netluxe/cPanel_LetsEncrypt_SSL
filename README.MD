# A script for automatically getting and installing a letsencrypt key on a cPanel Server

## Installation
Letsencrypt must already be set up, via the instructions here:

https://forums.cpanel.net/threads/how-to-installing-ssl-from-lets-encrypt.513621/

Follow those instructions up to: "Generate an SSL"

Then switch to this script.

Get this with:

git clone https://dev.whitwell.xyz/tnwhitwell/cPanel_SSL.git /root/ssl

The root password must be set in installssl.pl (sorry)
